# Cifar-10-Image-Classification-with-Tensorflow-2.0
In this guided project, we will build, train, and test a deep neural network model  to classify low-resolution images containing airplanes, cars, birds, cats, ships, and trucks in Keras and Tensorflow 2.0. We will use Cifar-10 which is a benchmark dataset that stands for the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR) and contains 60,000 32x32 color images. This project is practical and directly applicable to many industries.
